 ✅ What I focus on
- Web UI + REST API testing (automation-first, practical coverage)
- CI visibility (fast feedback, readable outcomes)
- Flake-resistant automation (smart waits, locator discipline, test-data control)
- AI output validation (non-determinism, edge cases, regression signals)

 🧭 Quality principles (how I work)
- Signal over noise: failures should be easy to understand
- Stability is a feature: reliability matters as much as coverage
- Design for CI: repeatable runs, predictable environments, fast triage
- Think in risk: protect the release-critical flows first
