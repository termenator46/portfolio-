 QA Automation Engineer Portfolio (SDET)

A production-style portfolio that shows how I build **release confidence** through stable automation, clear test signals, and CI-ready workflows.

 What I focus on
- Web UI + REST API testing (automation-first, practical coverage)
- CI visibility (fast feedback, readable outcomes)
- Flake-resistant automation** (smart waits, locator discipline, test-data control)
- AI output validation (non-determinism, edge cases, regression signals)

 Quality principles (how I work)
- Signal over noise: tests should explain failures, not create chaos  
- Stability is a feature: reliability matters as much as coverage  
- Design for CI: repeatable runs, fast triage, predictable environments  
- Think in risk: prioritize flows that protect the release  

 What’s inside
- One-page layout (About / Resume / Projects / Contact)
- Projects with short “impact” highlights
- Working contact form (no backend required)

 Tech
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- GitHub Pages
- FormSubmit (email delivery)
